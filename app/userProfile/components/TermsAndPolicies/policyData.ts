export const returnPolicyText = `TrendRush offers a hassle-free return and exchange policy to ensure customer satisfaction. You can return most items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund or exchange.

To be eligible for a return, items must be unused, in their original condition, and in the original packaging. Some items, such as intimate apparel, custom-made items, and perishable goods, are not eligible for return.

To initiate a return, contact our customer support team or use the return option in your account. We will provide you with a return authorization and instructions for shipping the item back to us.

Return shipping costs may apply unless the item was defective or we made an error. We recommend using a trackable shipping method for returns.

Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will process your refund or exchange. Refunds will be credited to your original payment method within 5-7 business days.

Exchanges are subject to product availability. If the item you want to exchange for is not available, we will process a refund instead.

For damaged or defective items, please contact us immediately upon receipt. We will arrange for a replacement or refund at no cost to you.

If you have any questions about our return policy, please contact our customer support team for assistance.`;
